"""Minify Javascript and CSS with YUI Compressor. This filter defaults to
JS mode, but it is recommended that you use the 'yui_js' and 'yui_css'
filters instead.

YUI Compressor is an external tool, which needs to be available (also, java
is required).

You can define a YUI_COMPRESSOR_PATH setting that points to the .jar file.
Otherwise, we will attempt to find the path via an environment variable by
the same name. The filter will also look for a JAVA_HOME environment
variable to run the .jar file, or will otherwise assume that "java" is
on the system path.
