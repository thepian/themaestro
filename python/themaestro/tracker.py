"""As an optional feature, we can try to keep track of the assets used. This
makes it easier to run a manual rebuild.

In the future, it can also help deciding when an asset needs an automatic
update. For instance:
    - We might auto update when the hash changes, wheras the old hash to
      compare against will be stored by the tracker.
    - We might use the tracked assets to compare timestamps if that turns
      out to be faster than a stat() call.
    - Right now, if asset properties like the applied filters or the list
      of source files change, without causing the source timestamp to
      change, the update will not be automatically picked up. As those
      information could be tracked and then be used to detect changes.
