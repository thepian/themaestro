Obviously you’d want to change a few things here. someclip.avi should be the name of you movie clip file that ffmpeg will be processing.
thumb.jpg 
is the name of the 
file to save the thumbnail in. 
10 nearby the -ss option tells ffmpeg how many seconds from the start of the clip you want to skip. 
If you want to skip a few minutes or hours, or specify a split second, then check ffmpeg manual for the syntax.
And the last option that should be interesting for you is the -s which in my example has the value of 150×100 - the size of the image
in pixels (X,Y).
