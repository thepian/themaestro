The tests in the 'source' subdirectory came from the V8 Javascript Engine
codebase. They have been ever-so-slightly modified, as a few of them were
originally using %-symbols as parts of function names, and object getters and
setters, which PyNarcissus is not supporting.

The point of these tests is to simply compare the parse tree output of the
original Narcissus with that of PyNarcissus.
