		<field type="TextField" name="body_source">A 3000 years old Chinese pattern has been used in Barney Boots´ autumn collection for women. The boot “Musel” has, like the rest of the new designs this season a light grey background. 

The classic pattern is drawn and painted on the high boot with a clear blue color. And, as always when we see the Musel pattern, for example on porcelain, every stroke is unique and not entirely as the other – every boot, every pair of boots, has its own expression. 

Unlike the other hand painted rubber boots/wellingtons for women from Barney Boots, the Musel boot has a matching buckle on the outer side. </field>

		<field type="TextField" name="body_source">Barney Boots for children are made for hours of play in the muddy puddles. A collar keeps the fitted boot in place and the water away from the feet.
The boot is made of breathable natural rubber, which keeps the feet warm and dry. Natural rubber is also much softer then for example PVC, which gives more flexibility and is easier to walk with – in particular for the children. 

With our “puddle indicator”, which is to be found on the back of the boots, the children can measure the depth of the puddles - to the great amusement for the little ones.

Barney Boots are also made for women. Everyone wants to be unique and that is something that we at Barney Boots embrace and tries to live up to in our designs. 

Today, rubber boots/wellingtons are becoming trendy and are being used more and more as accessories. 

They may very well have colors and attitude that supports and matches the rest of the outfit.
